      <h1>Let's go on a date</h1>
      <p>Because it's time to have some fun. We'll do it in August, whether hail, rain or sun!</p>
      <p>I've made this little webpage and I've used some CSS. Now that you're an expert too, I hope I'll pass the
        test!</p>
      <p>In case it isn't clear at first, this is designed to rhyme. But that stops with this paragraph - I've only
        finite time.</p>
      <p>I have a few ideas and have supplied illustrative photos... xxxxxxx<p>
      <p>By the way, I love you!</p>

      <h2>A family night at the Bach</h2>
      <img src="hut.jpg" class="full-width-image" />
      <p class="caption">Disclaimer: Hut may vary from depiction. Man in photo not included.</p>
      <p>Fire stoking, star gazing, exploring and more...</p>

      <h2>A movie date</h2>
      <p>Watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4698684/">Hunt for the Wilderpeople</a> (would have to be <strong>
        soon</strong>), or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4196776/">Jason Bourne</a> (which comes out on 28 
        July)...</p>

      <h2>Live music</h2>
      <img src="live_music_tonite.jpg" class="full-width-image" />
      <p>We'll find the best looking live music we can, and go to it! And if we don't like it, we can crawl the town 
        and find something else!</p>

      <h2>A games night at the neighbours'</h2>
      <img src="board_game.jpg" class="full-width-image" />
      <p>With Devon looking after Ciaran. We need to make it happen soon!</p>

      <h2>Mini golf</h2>
      <img src="mini_golf.jpg" class="full-width-image" />
      <p>See if I can beat you this time...</p>

      <h2>Thoughts?</h2>
      <p><a href="mailto:george@dewar.co.nz?subject=Date&body=%0A%0A%0AP.S. You are the bees knees! I think you should
